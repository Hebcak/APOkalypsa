As our semestral project, we would like to make the classic computer game PONG. This game is basicaly a computer version of table tennis. It is a two player game, each player controls one paddle. There is a moving ball on the screen, the goal is to hit the ball with your paddle and direct it so that the other player cannot block it and the ball "passes through" the edge of the screen behind the other players paddle.

Features:
	The game
		the paddles will be controlled by the rotating knobs
		when player gets a point, the LEDs will blink
		the score is indicated on the LED strip
		the game ends, when all LEDs on the strip are on (the sum of both players score is 32)
			the end screen pops up, showing, who won
			the players can admire the app and then return to the main menu by pressing the middle knob
	It will be possible to pause the game
		Pause menu: return to the game, go to main menu
	The main menu
		start game
		change player one name
		change player two name
	Serial port communication
		used to change the players names
		tells the status of the game (score, start, end...)
		because of the difficulty of physical testing, it will be also somewhat possible to controll the game using a keyboard
