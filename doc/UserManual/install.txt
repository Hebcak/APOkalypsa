1. Download the code. You can use:
	'git clone https://github.com/Hebcak/APOkalypsa.git'
	or download it as a .zip from github.
	If you downloaded it as a .zip, unzip it.
	
2. ONLY if you own a MZapo board with the NEW LCD screen, uncomment line 18 (#define ILI9481) in the file: src/mzapo_parlcd.c

3. If you haven't already, transfer the downloaded files to your board.

3. Build the app using the included makefile. (Go to the src folder in terminal and run 'make'.)

5. In the main folder next to the 'topic', 'doc' and 'src' folders should now be a PONG.o file. To play the game, run it: './PONG.o'.
